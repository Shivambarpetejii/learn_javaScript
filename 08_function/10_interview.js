what is a function in javascript?

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions can take inputs, process them, and return a result.



How do you define a function?

Functions can be defined using function declarations or function expressions.



What is a function declaration?

A function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters and code block. The function can be called before it is defined due to hoisting.


What is a function expression?

A function expression defines a function inside an expression. The function can be anonymous and is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before it is defined.


What are arrow functions?

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own this context and are not hoisted.

How do you call a function?

You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, which may include arguments.
